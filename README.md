### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kyle, a machine learning researcher and software engineer. I'm currently pursuing my M.S. in Machine Learning and Data Science at the University of California, San Diego.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with people to develop startups. I love starting and finishing ideas that truly impact people.
- ðŸ“« Feel free to email me at kwade@ucsd.edu or kylewade13731@gmail.com (I check both).
- âš¡ Fun fact: I know 300+ digits of pi (ask me to recite them!)
