I'm Kyle, a machine learning researcher and software engineer.

I am currently building a bunch of things, one of which is osu! capital (https://osucapital.com), a viritual stock market which uses quantitative analysis to rank osu! players as stocks for people to invest in. Currently, the platform has +100,000 users.

I build a ton of SaaS products. If you're interested in contacting me, email me: kwade@ucsd.edu
