### Hello there 👋

I'm Kyle, a computer engineering university student passionate about software development.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on https://www.mariokartcentral.com and another secret project (:
- 🌱 I’m currently studying artificial intelligence and machine learning.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with people for hackathons. I love starting and finishing ideas that truly impact people.
- 📫 Feel free to email me at kwade@ucsd.edu or kylewade13731@gmail.com (I check both).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I memorized 300+ digits of pi for a pi competition in middle school to throw a pie at my principal. I won the competition, yet when I went to throw the pie, I missed in front of the whole school. But hey, at least I got a party trick out of it.
